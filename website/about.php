            <p>We are second-year students at the Erasmus University College Brussels studying Applied Computer Sciences. <br> We created this site as part of our second Software Project, though our desire to create this site has existed long before the assignment. We were fed up with using spreadsheets to keep track of our trades on exchanges, and there was no good product available that could fulfull our wishes, so the assignment was as good of a reason as any to start building this site. <br> In the end, we are proud of what we have achieved, and we have learned a lot during the process.</p>
